A small educational project demonstrating core Agentic AI concepts:

- Goal → subtasks (Agent)
- Tool use (time estimator)
- Reflection (clarity improvement)
- Objective & subjective evaluation
- Log saving

This project uses:
- Python only
- Mocked LLM responses for offline use
- Optional Groq API integration (set `USE_API = True` in agent.py)
